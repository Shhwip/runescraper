          Runescraper is a web application that scrapes the Old School Runescape
          wiki for teleport information and then displays it on a leaflet map.

      <div className="w-5/6">
        My friend was playing runescape and would constantly send me texts
        throughout the day asking me the fastest route from one part of the game
        to the other. Sometimes I wasnâ€™t by my phone so he would spend 20
        minutes walking to a place that had an in game teleport. I asked him if
        he wanted a tool that would help him navigate. He gave me the following
        minimum requirements:
      </div>
      <ol className="pl-5 list-decimal">
        <li>
          A map
          <ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
            <li>Can pan and zoom.</li>
            <li>Shows the whole in game world</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          All teleports
          <ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
            <li>Visible on the map to where they teleport</li>
            <li>Show what they look like in game</li>
            <li>Shows the name of the teleport</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

        While looking for options I quickly found Leaflet.js which in its basic
        demo, has a map, tiles of your choice, and marker with text. Everything
        I need.

if you are looking to do something like this then follow this tutorial instead"
